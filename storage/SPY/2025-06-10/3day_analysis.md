- **Target**: $595 (mean reversion)
- **Stop**: $589.50

## üìä 3-Day Scenario Analysis

### **Bullish Scenario (30% probability)**:
- CPI comes in below 2.5% YoY
- SPY breaks above $605, targets $610
- Fed rate cut expectations increase

### **Base Case (50% probability)**:
- CPI inline at 2.8-2.9% YoY
- SPY ranges $595-605
- Drift toward max pain levels

### **Bearish Scenario (20% probability)**:
- CPI above 3.0% YoY
- Test of $590 put wall
- Increased volatility, VIX spike

## ‚ö° Order Flow Integration Signals

**Watch For**:
1. **At $590**: Large bid prints, put rolling activity
2. **At $600**: Delta hedging flows, call/put volume ratio
3. **At $605**: Call selling pressure, gamma unwind
4. **Post-CPI**: Institution repositioning in first 30 minutes

## üéØ Actionable Trade for Tomorrow

**Primary Trade**: 
Given the bearish ORB break today and CPI uncertainty tomorrow, the highest probability trade is:

**Buy June 11 $597P / Sell $593P spread**
- Entry: $1.20-1.40
- Target: $3.00 if CPI disappoints
- Stop: $0.60
- Risk/Reward: 1:2.5

This captures the max pain drift while limiting risk into the binary CPI event.

## üìã Economic Calendar Impact

### June 11 - CPI Release Day
- **Time**: 8:30 AM ET
- **Consensus**: ~2.8% YoY (estimated)
- **Market Impact**: HIGH - Binary event that will set tone for remainder of week
- **Fed Implications**: Current fed funds at 4.25-4.50%, market pricing 2 cuts in 2025

### Market Context
- Fed in "wait-and-see" mode on rates
- Tariff uncertainty adding to inflation concerns
- Q1 GDP contracted at -0.3%, but employment remains strong
- Current inflation running at 2.3-2.8% YoY (above Fed's 2% target)

## üîç Key Takeaways

1. **Major Binary Event**: CPI on June 11 will dominate price action
2. **Gamma Wall at $610**: Expect strong resistance, unlikely to break pre-CPI
3. **Put Wall at $590**: Institutional support level, high probability bounce zone
4. **Max Pain Drift**: Natural gravitation toward $596-599 by June 12
5. **Volatility Play**: Consider volatility strategies given CPI uncertainty
