## Summary & Key Takeaways 📌

The market is positioned for a defensive week with massive put protection in place. The combination of elevated put/call ratios, key economic data, and technical resistance at $600 suggests limited upside potential. Focus on put strategies with careful risk management around CPI/PPI releases. The highest probability trade is fading rallies to $598-$600 with downside targets at max pain levels $590-$595.

**Remember**: Options open interest creates gravity - prices tend to gravitate toward max pain, especially into expiration. Trade with this bias but respect stops if momentum shifts.
