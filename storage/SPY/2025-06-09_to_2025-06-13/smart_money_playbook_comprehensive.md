1. **EXTREME DOWNSIDE PROTECTION**: `$470` strike has 71,117 puts (disaster hedge)
2. **BATTLE ZONE**: `$595-600` range is the epicenter of gamma warfare
3. **CPI TUESDAY**: June 11 inflation data is THE catalyst
4. **BEARISH LEAN**: Technical breakdown confirmed, but support levels are well-defended

**Bottom Line**: Institutions expect volatile whipsaw action around CPI, with initial downside to `$590-585` before potential recovery.

## **PART 1: THE SMART MONEY SETUP**

### **Institutional Positioning Matrix**

#### **MASSIVE PUT WALLS (Defense Levels)**
1. **`$591.00`** - 11,383 puts (Tuesday expiry) - **CRITICAL MAGNET**
2. **`$580.00`** - 26,248 puts (Friday monthly) - **INSTITUTIONAL FLOOR**
3. **`$570.00`** - 23,818 puts - **DISASTER PROTECTION**
4. **`$470.00`** - 71,117 puts - **BLACK SWAN HEDGE**

#### **CALL CEILINGS (Resistance)**
1. **`$600.00`** - 13,074 calls - **GAMMA WALL**
2. **`$605.00`** - 9,114 calls - **BREAKOUT TRIGGER**

## **CONCLUSION: THE SMART MONEY SECRET**

The institutional playbook for next week is clear: **protect and collect**. They're protected through massive put positions while collecting premium from retail option buyers. The `$591` put wall on Tuesday and `$580` support for Friday are the KEY LEVELS.

**The Edge**: While retail chases momentum, smart money is fading moves at extremes and positioning for mean reversion around the massive option strikes.

Stay disciplined, respect the levels, and remember: in options expiration week, the market moves toward maximum pain, not maximum gain.
