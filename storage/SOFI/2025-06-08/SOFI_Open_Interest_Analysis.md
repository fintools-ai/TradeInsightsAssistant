3. Call skew weighted toward $15+ strikes (upside bets)

### Bearish Signals:
1. Heavy call resistance at $14.50 and $15.00
2. June 20 expiry has balanced Put/Call ratio (1.09)
3. Limited call OI above $16

## Trading Implications

### Near-Term (1-2 weeks):
- Range-bound between $13.50-$14.50
- June 13 OPEX likely pins to $13.50
- FOMC catalyst needed to break $14.50

### Medium-Term (3-4 weeks):
- Post-FOMC breakout target: $15.00-$15.50
- June 20 OPEX massive - expect volatility
- July positioning starts after June expirations

### Longer-Term (5-6 weeks):
- Earnings run could target $16.00
- July 18 expiry shows bullish positioning
- Break above $15 opens path to $17-18

## Risk Factors
1. Break below $13.00 triggers stop-loss cascade
2. Fed hawkish surprise could test $12.00
3. Pre-earnings profit-taking above $16.00
4. Summer volume decline reduces momentum

## Recommended Strategy
**Primary**: Buy calls on dips to support ($13.00-$13.50)  
**Secondary**: Sell calls at resistance ($14.50-$15.00)  
**Hedge**: Buy puts only on breaks below $13.00  
**Position Size**: Scale in 1/3 positions at each level
