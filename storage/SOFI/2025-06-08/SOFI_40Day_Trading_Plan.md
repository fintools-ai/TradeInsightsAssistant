## Summary Strategy
The 40-day outlook is bullish with a target of $16.00-$16.50, driven by:
1. Strong institutional support at $12-13
2. FOMC potentially dovish (rate cut expected)
3. Earnings momentum into July 28

Primary strategy is buying calls on dips to support levels, with protective puts only on overbought conditions or ahead of major events. The massive put wall at $12-13 provides a strong floor for accumulation.
