## Summary & Action Plan 🎯

HOOD is in a strong uptrend but showing signs of exhaustion after the S&P 500 snub. The stock will likely consolidate between $70-76 before making its next major move. The bullish open interest structure suggests institutions expect higher prices into earnings.

**Immediate Action**: Wait for pullback to $72 to initiate long positions. The risk/reward favors patient entries rather than chasing at current levels.

**30-Day Price Target**: $82.00 (based on Fibonacci extension and call positioning)  
**Downside Risk**: $65.00 (major support and put wall)

Focus on buying calls on dips to support levels and puts only for quick scalps at resistance. The overall bias remains bullish into July 30 earnings.
