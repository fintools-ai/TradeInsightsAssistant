2. **VXX drops below $55** (buy calls on weakness)
3. **TLT consolidates $84-$86** (buy calls before breakout)

### **Don't Chase:**

---

- **June 6th:** Minor expiration, some movement expected
- **June 13th:** Major SPY expiration (394,848 OI) - Peak volatility expected
- **June 20th:** Massive expiration across all three assets - Final resolution

**Expected Timeline:** 5-15 trading days for moves to play out

---

## **What Could Go Wrong (Risk Factors)**

### **Bearish Thesis Fails If:**
- SPY holds above $585 and rallies
- VXX fails to break above $57
- TLT fails to hold $84 support

### **Market Structure Risks:**
- Institutions could be hedging, not speculating
- Options could expire worthless if no catalyst
- Time decay accelerates as expiration approaches

---

## **Simple Execution Plan**

### **Day 1-2: Setup Positions**
1. **Watch for SPY bounce** to $585+ → Buy puts
2. **Watch for VXX weakness** below $55 → Buy calls
3. **Watch for TLT consolidation** $84-86 → Buy calls

### **Day 3-10: Manage Positions**
- **Take 50% profits** on any position up 75%+
- **Cut losses** at 50% down on any position
- **Don't hold to expiration** unless deep in the money

### **Day 10-15: Exit Strategy**
- **Close all positions** 1 week before expiration

2. **VXX spike** (0.63 P/C ratio, heavy call accumulation)
3. **TLT rally** (0.67 P/C ratio, 75,856 calls at $94)

**This suggests a coordinated risk-off event is expected.**

**Trade accordingly, but manage risk carefully - institutions can be wrong too.**
