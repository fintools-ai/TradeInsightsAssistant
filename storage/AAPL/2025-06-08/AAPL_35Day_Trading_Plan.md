## Summary Strategy
The 35-day outlook hinges on WWDC outcomes. Base case is range-bound $200-215 with potential breakout post-WWDC if AI announcements exceed expectations. The massive put support at $200 provides a floor, while heavy call resistance at $210-215 caps upside without catalyst.

**Primary approach**: Buy calls on dips to $200-202, buy puts on rallies to $210-215. WWDC week requires straddle approach due to binary outcome risk. Focus on June 20 and July 18 expirations for swing trades.
